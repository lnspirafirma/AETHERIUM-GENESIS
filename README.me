This PR initializes the AETHERIUM-GENESIS project structure and core components according to the "Firma" architecture blueprint.

**Key Changes:**
1.  **Project Structure:** Created `core/`, `agents/`, `config/`, and `tests/` directories.
2.  **Core Infrastructure:**
    *   `AetherConductor`: Async event bus with Pub/Sub and Trust Scoring/Quarantine logic.
    *   `Envelope`: Immutable data carrier with Canonical Hashing.
    *   `KnowledgeCentricProcessor (KCP)`: Implements "Dialectical Thinking" (Thesis -> Antithesis -> Synthesis) using a mock Graph and Vector DB.
3.  **Agents:**
    *   `AgioSageAgent`: Integrated with KCP to provide wisdom-based responses.
    *   `GEPPolicyEnforcer`: Implements governance rules and audit gates.
    *   `UposathaCleanerAgent`: Background agent for system entropy reduction (cleanup).
4.  **Testing:**
    *   Added `pytest` suite with `pytest-asyncio` and `pytest-cov`.
    *   Achieved >90% code coverage across core modules.
    *   Verified "Dialectical Thought" generation and Graph/Vector DB interactions.

**Fixes:**
*   Fixed argument order mismatch in `SimpleKnowledgeGraph.add_edge` and `load_mock_data`.
*   Fixed dependency injection order in `KnowledgeCentricProcessor`.
